# Group Regularization for Zero-Inflated Count Regression Model with an Application to Female PhD Student's Scientific Productivity

The systemic differences in the outcomes that men and women achieve in health, education, economy and politics, also known as the Gender Gap, has been one of the biggest problem the world is trying to solve. In particular, this is evident in the academic world where women are underrepresented especially in academic science programs. Several studies have been made regarding the Gender Gap and some of these studies use zero inflated data and does not use grouped covariates, which can provide a better method of analysis compared to regular EM LASSO in terms of model error and in computational overhead. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an algorithm called Group regularization for zero-inflated model (GOOOGLE) developed by Chatterjee et Al. and Chowdhury et Al. (2018) using the productivity data of PhD students in terms of published articles, with gender as one of the response variables. The GOOOGLE method in its Poisson Regression Form using a Bridge variable selector showed that the quality of the graduate program and the mentor is the biggest indicator of a productive PhD student. However, it also showed that being a female and having young kids are indicators of a non-productive PhD student. To battle the Gender Gap, it is recommended that graduate programs and mentors of the highest quality to take more female students.
