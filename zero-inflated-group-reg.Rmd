abstract: The systemic differences in the outcomes that men and women achieve in health, education, economy and politics, also known as the Gender Gap, has been one of the biggest problem the world is trying to solve. In particular, this is evident in the academic world where women are underrepresented especially in academic science programs. Several studies have been made regarding the Gender Gap and some of these studies use zero inflated data and does not use grouped covariates, which can provide a better method of analysis compared to regular EM LASSO in terms of model error and in computational overhead. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an algorithm called Group regularization for zero-inflated model (GOOOGLE) developed by Chatterjee et Al. and Chowdhury et Al. (2018) using the productivity data of PhD students in terms of published articles, with gender as one of the response variables. The GOOOGLE method in its Poisson Regression Form using a Bridge variable selector showed that the quality of the graduate program and the mentor is the biggest indicator of a productive PhD student. However, it also showed that being a female and having young kids are indicators of a non-productive PhD student. To battle the Gender Gap, it is recommended that graduate programs and mentors of the highest quality to take more female students.

## Introduction

The Gender Gap has existed throughout history [@Kleinberg1991-uy]. While we have seen a significant closing of the gap in recent years, it is estimated that the gap between men and women, measured in terms of political influence, economic gain and health and education will take 99.5 years to close according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). The lack of representation of women in emerging fields such as Cloud Computing and AI is contributing to this gap, even though we are seeing that more women are currently taking positions of power throughout the world [@Han2019-au].

One of the most factors that are checked in the Gender Gap issue is gender equality in terms of educational attainment. In the 2019 WEF report, only 35 countries has achieved this. However, compared to other Gender Gap areas, this is the most attainable in the near future where WEF expects that all countries will eliminate the Gender Gap in the next 12 years [@Munene2019-vx] [@Alfarhan2019-hw]. It is important to tackle this at a doctoral level, as this is the period where many women are in the age of having kids and thus in the traditional society, are expected to leave their careers to pursue motherhood solely. 

The nature of most data regarding post-doctoral studies on the scientific publications of PhD students are zero-inflated. This means that most of these students don't have publications, or are still working on creating one. Normal Negative Binomial and Poisson Regression model cannot handle this due to the number of zeros in the dataset. 

In this paper, we implement two new methods of modelling for a zero-inflated dataset with group regularization using a Negative Binomial Regression Model [@Chatterjee2018-eh] and then using a Poisson Regression Model [@Chowdhury2019-jh]. For the dataset, we used the data from the AER package in R called PhDPublications from [@Long1990-db]. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of such dataset to this newly created models.


## Review of Related Literature

Gender Gap has been one of the most talked about topics in the past century. Most of the studies made are economic ones [@Kleinberg1991-uy], usually tackling pay [@Han2019-au] as the main point. There are also studies about the political aspect of such [@Mueller1988-xq]. Interestingly, physiological effects have also been studied such as Gender Gap in heart failure [@Lin2019-kf], life expectancy [@Oecd2018-it] and even on the genes itself [@Barash2017-gd].

Moreover, Gender Gap tackling specifically education has also been well-studied. In [@Alfarhan2019-hw], they have revisited the gap in terms of academic achievement while in [@Munene2019-vx] they revisited it in terms of patriarchy. Several authors have also given in-depth solutions in terms of academic participation [@Stout2013-me], cognitive and social-emotional skills gap bridging [@Nakajima2019-ll], and most importantly relating this gap to earnings [@Han2019-au]. 

In the work of [@Long1990-db], he was able to pinpoint the origin of sex difference in science. In his work, he related the number of publications made by PhD students in relation to the graduate program, mentor, number of young kids, gender and if the student is married. The data he used is zero-inflated, with many of the students having no publications in the last 3 years of their PhD. During his time, he used the usual zero inflated models. 

The recent work of [@Chatterjee2018-eh] and [@Chowdhury2019-jh] has showed a lot of promise in modelling zero-inflated data. In their work, they utilized group regularization to improve the overall performance of the Negative Binomial and Poisson Zero Inflated Model. Zero-inflated models have been used in many modelling applications in number of falls in the elderly [@Ob2017-ts], aphid population study [@Carvalho2019-gd], HIV mortality [@Musal2013-be], disease mapping [@Torabi2017-os], dental caries [@Gilthorpe2009-nz] and cardiac surgery in children [@Wang2014-ws], among others. The data and the work of [@Long1990-db] can surely benefit in this newly minted technique.

## Methodology

Zero-inflated models assume that a significant population will have zero as their response variable. From [@Greene1994-mh], Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) mixture distribution can be written as:

$$
P\left(y_{i}=k\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{p_{i}+\left(1-p_{i}\right)\left(\frac{\alpha^{-1}}{\alpha^{-1}+\mu}\right)^{\alpha^{-1}}} & {\text { if } k=0} \\ {\left(1-p_{i}\right) \frac{\Gamma\left(\alpha^{-1}+k\right)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma\left(\alpha^{-1}\right)}\left(\frac{\mu_{i}}{\alpha^{-1}+\mu_{i}}\right)^{k}\left(\frac{\alpha^{-1}}{\alpha^{-1}+\mu_{i}}\right)^{\alpha^{\prime}}} & {\text { if } k=1,2, \cdots}\end{array}\right.
$$

For n observations, the ZINB negative log-likelihood is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} L(\theta)=&-\sum_{y=0} \log \left[p_{t}+\left(1-p_{t}\right)\left(\frac{\alpha^{-1}}{\mu_{t}+\alpha^{-1}}\right)^{\alpha^{-1}}\right] \\ &-\sum_{y \leq 0} \log \left[\left(1-p_{t}\right) \frac{\Gamma\left(\alpha^{-1}+y_{1}\right)}{\Gamma\left(y_{t}+1\right) \Gamma\left(\alpha^{-1}\right)}\left(\frac{\mu_{t}}{\mu_{t}+\alpha^{-1}}\right)^{n}\left(\frac{\alpha^{-1}}{\mu_{t}+\alpha^{-1}}\right)^{\alpha^{-1}}\right] \end{aligned}
$$

For the Poisson model, we assume that the variance should at least be well-approximated by the mean. The Negative Binomial model is used to account for overdispersion, only a slightly less parsimonious.

The groupings the authors created are least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), bridge, smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and minimax concave penalty (MCP) which carries different penalty terms. The equations below shows that penalty terms of various group methods under GOOOGLE. The full explanation of the methodology can be seen in [@Chatterjee2018-eh] and [@Chowdhury2019-jh]. 

Group LASSO Penalty Term:
$$
\lambda_{n} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sqrt{m_{k}}\left\|\theta_{A_{k}}\right\|_{2}
$$
Group bridge Penalty Term:
$$
\lambda_{n} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sqrt{m_{k}}\left\|\theta_{A_{k}}\right\|_{1}^{v}, 0<v<1
$$
Group SCAD Penalty Term:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{k} \rho\left(\left\|\theta_{A_{k}}\right\|_{2} ; j m_{k} \lambda_{n}, v\right), \rho\left(x_{i}, \lambda_{n}, v\right)=\lambda_{n} \int_{0}^{k} \min \left\{1,\left(v-t / \lambda_{n}\right)_{+} /(v-1)\right\} d t, v>2
$$
Group MCP Penalty Term:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{k} p\left(\left\|\theta_{A}\right\|_{2} ; v_{m} \lambda_{n}, v\right), \rho\left(x ; \lambda_{n}, v\right)=\lambda_{n} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1-t /\left(v \lambda_{n}\right)\right)_{+} d t, v>1

## Results

In this paper, we implement the group regularization for zero-inflated regression model in both the Negative Binomial and the Poisson form, using PhD Publications data from the R AER package. The dataset contains 915 observations pertaining to the cross-sectional data on the scientific productivity of PhD students in biochemistry. This was from the study of Long J.S. where they tackled the origin of sex difference in science. There were six variables in the study, and all were used in the paper. Table 1 shows the description of the predictor variables, stratified by groups, in the PhD Publications data. Take note that similar to how the original authors of the GOOOGLE method, we express each continuous predictor as a group of three cubic splines variables (*prestige, mentor and kids*), resulting to a total of 11 candidate predictors, three of which are triplets and two are singleton groups.

The variable that we want to predict is the number of publications a PhD student makes. We look at the distribution of the said data in Figure 1. Here, we can see that clearly, a huge chunk of the data are zeroes which tells us that traditional models such as regular Poisson and Negative Binomial regression cannot fully model the said dataset.

![Number of articles published during last 3 years of PhD.](histogram.png)

In the paper of [@Chatterjee2018-eh] and [@Chowdhury2019-jh], they already showed that GOOOGLE significantly outperforms published non-grouped EM LASSO method in out-of-sample prediction. They also showed that GOOOGLE was significantly faster in terms of computational overhead compared to EM LASSO which was 20 to 25 times slower. In this paper, we show the performance of GOOOGLE in the PhD Studies dataset in Poisson and Negative Binomial Regression form. We also show the performance per group variable selection method (LASSO, MCP, SCAD and Bridge). 

It should be noted that the LASSO, MCP and SCAD group variable selection offers all variables in the model while the Bridge group variable selection offers a selection procedure where only the most significant coefficients are added. The selection of the "best" model in terms of statistical measures is not part of the scope of this paper. 

Table 2 and 3 shows the coefficient estimates for the count and zero submodel in the PhD Studies data analysis for the Negative Binomial regression form of GOOOGLE. From Table 4, the zero submodel appears to be inflated in many of the group variable selection method and thus, does not appear to be the best selection for a GOOOGLE model. Overall, the Negative Binomial count submodel shows that prestige and mentor positively affects the number of articles published by a PhD student while having kids and being females affects it negatively. 

Table 4 and 5 on the other hand shows the coefficient estimates for the count and zero submodel in the PhD Studies data analysis for the Poisson regression form of GOOOGLE. Similar to the zero count model previously seen, the coefficients appears to be inflated with confusing signs, depending on the group value number. Again, it appears that the zero count (logistic) model is not appropriate given the dataset. The Poisson count model shows a better level of coefficient factors. Similar to the Negative Binomial count submodel, it also indicates that prestige and mentor is a positive factor for number of articles published by a PhD student while kids and being a female are negative factors.

Overall, we will choose the GOOOGLE method in its Poisson Regression form with Bridge as the group variable selection method as our model. Here, we can see that the top contributor on the number of articles a PhD will publish in their last 3 years of PhD is the quality of the mentor, specifically the number of articles published by their mentor has. Next will be the prestige of the graduate program, with the higher prestige of the program the better chances of having more published articles. This is intuitive as we would expect that the quality of mentorship and the graduate program itself would be the main factor for productivity.

It has also been found that having kids is the most significant factor in publishing less articles, followed by being a female. This is also intuitive as we would usually have parents take more leaves and would need more personal time with their young kids compared to those without one. This takes a toll more on females given that they are usually tasked to take care of the kids.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

We have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the Group regularization for zero-inflated model (GOOOGLE) method created by [@Chatterjee2018-eh] and [@Chowdhury2019-jh] using PhD Studies data by [@Long1990-db]. Among all GOOOGLE methods, the Poisson Regression Form using a Bridge variable selector was selected to model the said data. It has been found that the quality of the graduate program and the mentor is the biggest indicator of a productive PhD student. This is expected as quality education (higher prestige score) and educators (mentors that are also productive) are very likely the reasons why a PhD student is able to produce more published research papers.

However, the same model also showed that being a female and having young kids are indicators of a non-productive PhD student. Interestly, being married is not considered to be a significant factor, either as a good or bad influencer of PhD productivity. It appears that bearing a child and taking care of it burdens the female PhD student in being more productive. This is explainable as female PhD students will likely be in majority, if not solely, the caretaker of their young child.  

To battle the Gender Gap, it is recommended that graduate programs and mentors of the highest quality to take more female students. This will enable more productive female PhDs. In addition, the fact the having young kids and being female are both indicators of a less productive PhD student, there should be more opportunities for female PhDs to focus on their careers while having a kids. This can be of the form of day care centers, nannies or just the simple sharing of responsibility of taking care of their young children with their husbands. It should be noted though that further studies much be taken before implementing the these recommendations.

Aside from that, other variations other than the Poisson and Negative Binomial count models can be explored. One model is the Poisson Inverse Gaussian Model, which provide for adjustment of greater amounts of overdispersion than the negative binomial model. Another path that can be taken is a time-series path, where we account for the temporal changes of the data. We can also do a Bayesian approach on this one, so we can add priors to our predictions.

Furthermore, improvements in the data can also been done. The data that was used in this study is relatively old. It would be beneficial to know the most recent status of the productivity of PhD students, as the realities might have changed already in the past few years.
